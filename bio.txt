I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page">CLIP Lab</a> , University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Prof. <a href="https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~ying/">Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber</a>. I am fortunate to work in close collaborations with Prof. <a href="https://rudinger.github.io/">Rachel Rudinger</a> and Prof. <a href="https://tianyizhou.github.io/">Tianyi Zhou</a>.
My research interests span human-centered natural language processing, multimodal reasoning, cognitive evaluation of AI systems, and personalized language generation. I have worked on aligning AI outputs with human intent, group preferences, and cognitive constructs such as Theory of Mind. Ishani has previously held research positions at Microsoft Research, Adobe Research, IBM Research UK, TCS Research, and IIT Kharagpur, contributing to projects at the intersection of language, reasoning, and social impact.

# Improving the RDF Generated

At the end of week 2, I have generated the RDF of the Obama Abstract. But I was using loosing out some of the most important triples which are possible to generate. This necessitated to include more information in the white list I have prepared. In addition to that, I have also made use of an external ontology consisting of the synonyms and hypernyms/hyponyms of words, which is termed as the [Wordnet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/).
